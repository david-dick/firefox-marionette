=head1 NAME

Firefox::Marionette::Capabilities - Represents Firefox Capabilities retrieved using the Marionette protocol

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.34

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Firefox::Marionette();
    use v5.10;

    my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( capabilities => Firefox::Marionette::Capabilities->new( accept_insecure_certs => 0 ) );
    if ($firefox->capabilities->accept_insecure_certs()) {
        say "Browser will now ignore certificate failures";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module handles the implementation of Firefox Capabilities using the Marionette protocol

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 accept_insecure_certs

indicates whether untrusted and self-signed TLS certificates are implicitly trusted on navigation for the duration of the session.

=head2 browser_name

returns the browsers name.  For example 'firefox'

=head2 browser_version 

returns the version of L<firefox|https://firefox.com/>

=head2 enumerate

This method returns a list of strings describing the capabilities that this version of Firefox supports.

=head2 moz_accessibility_checks 

returns the current accessibility (a11y) value

=head2 moz_build_id

returns the L<Firefox BuildId|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/buildID>

=head2 moz_headless

returns whether the browser is running in headless mode

=head2 moz_process_id 

returns the process id belonging to the browser

=head2 moz_profile

returns the directory that contains the browsers profile

=head2 moz_shutdown_timeout

returns the value of L<moz:shutdownTimeout|https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/7aad85995b21bdaf440dc9dad35c5769a35e90eb#diff-48053ba06cc33be0efb2d7256a1affd9> (aka the value of config toolkit.asyncshutdown.crash_timeout)

=head2 moz_use_non_spec_compliant_pointer_origin

returns a boolean value to indicate how the pointer origin for an action command will be calculated.

With Firefox 59 the calculation will be based on the requirements by the WebDriver specification. This means that the pointer origin is no longer computed based on the top and left position of the referenced element, but on the in-view center point.

To temporarily disable the WebDriver conformant behavior use 0 as value for this capability.

Please note that this capability exists only temporarily, and that it will be removed once all Selenium bindings can handle the new behavior.

=head2 moz_webdriver_click

returns a boolean value to indicate which kind of interactability checks to run when performing a L<click|Firefox::Marionette#click> or L<sending keys|Firefox::Marionette#type> to an elements. For Firefoxen prior to version 58.0 some legacy code as imported from an older version of FirefoxDriver was in use.

With Firefox 58 the interactability checks as required by the WebDriver specification are enabled by default. This means geckodriver will additionally check if an element is obscured by another when clicking, and if an element is focusable for sending keys.

Because of this change in behaviour, we are aware that some extra errors could be returned. In most cases the test in question might have to be updated so it's conform with the new checks. But if the problem is located in geckodriver, then please raise an issue in the issue tracker.

To temporarily disable the WebDriver conformant checks use 0 as value for this capability.

Please note that this capability exists only temporarily, and that it will be removed once the interactability checks have been stabilized.

=head2 new
 
accepts a hash as a parameter.  Allowed keys are below;

=over 4

=item * accept_insecure_certs - Indicates whether untrusted and self-signed TLS certificates are implicitly trusted on navigation for the duration of the session. Allowed values are 1 or 0.  Default is 0.

=item * moz_accessibility_checks - run a11y checks when clicking elements. Allowed values are 1 or 0.  Default is 0.

=item * moz_headless - the browser should be started with the -headless option.  moz_headless is only supported in Firefox 56+

=item * moz_use_non_spec_compliant_pointer_origin - a boolean value to indicate how the pointer origin for an action command will be calculated.

With Firefox 59 the calculation will be based on the requirements by the WebDriver specification. This means that the pointer origin is no longer computed based on the top and left position of the referenced element, but on the in-view center point.

To temporarily disable the WebDriver conformant behavior use 0 as value for this capability.

Please note that this capability exists only temporarily, and that it will be removed once all Selenium bindings can handle the new behavior.

=item * moz_webdriver_click - a boolean value to indicate which kind of interactability checks to run when performing a L<click|Firefox::Marionette#click> or L<sending keys|Firefox::Marionette#type> to an elements. For Firefoxen prior to version 58.0 some legacy code as imported from an older version of FirefoxDriver was in use.

To temporarily disable the WebDriver conformant checks use 0 as value for this capability.

Please note that this capability exists only temporarily, and that it will be removed once the interactability checks have been stabilized.

=item * page_load_strategy - defines the L<page load strategy|Firefox::Marionette::Capabilities#page_load_strategy> for the upcoming browser session.

=item * proxy - describes the L<proxy|Firefox::Marionette::Proxy> setup for the upcoming browser session.

=item * strict_file_interactability - a boolean value to indicate if interactability checks will be applied to <input type=file>. Allowed values are 1 or 0.  Default is 0.

=item * timeouts - describes the L<timeouts|Firefox::Marionette::Timeouts> imposed on certain session operations.

=item * unhandled_prompt_behavior - defines what firefox should do on encountering a L<user prompt|https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#user-prompts>.  There are a range of L<allowed values|https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-user-prompt-handler>, including "dismiss", "accept", "dismiss and notify", "accept and notify" and "ignore".

=back

This method returns a new L<capabilities|Firefox::Marionette::Capabilities> object.
 
=head2 page_load_strategy 

returns the L<page load strategy|https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-table-of-page-load-strategies> to use for the duration of the session. The page load strategy corresponds to the L<readyState|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState#Values> and may be one of the following values;

=over 4

=item * normal - Wait for the document and all sub-resources have finished loading.  The corresponding L<readyState|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState#Values> is "complete".  The L<load|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/load> event is about to fire.  This strategy is the default value.

=item * eager - Wait for the document to have finished loading and have been parsed.  Sub-resources such as images, stylesheets and frames are still loading.  The corresponding L<readyState|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState#Values> is "interactive".

=item * none - return immediately after starting navigation.  The corresponding L<readyState|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState#Values> is "loading".

=back

=head2 platform_name 

returns the operating system name. For example 'linux', 'darwin' or 'windows_nt'.

=head2 proxy

returns the current L<proxy|Firefox::Marionette::Proxy> object

=head2 platform_version

=head2 rotatable

does this version of L<firefox|https://firefox.com> have a rotatable screen such as Android Fennec.

=head2 set_window_rect

returns true if Firefox fully supports L<setWindowRect|https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-window-dimensioning-positioning>, otherwise it returns false.

=head2 strict_file_interactability

returns the current value of L<strictFileInteractability|https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-strict-file-interactability>

=head2 timeouts
