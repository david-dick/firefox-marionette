=head1 NAME

check-firefox-certificate-authorities - check the CA certificates in firefox for expired certificates

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.09

=head1 USAGE

  $ check-firefox-certificate-authorities 

  $ check-firefox-certificate-authorities --binary=/path/to/new/firefox

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is intended to easily check firefox for expired CA certificates.

By default, the only firefox version that may be used will be present in the PATH environment variable.  However, the user may specify a different path with
the --binary parameter.

It will print out the display name of any CA certificates that are expired or not yet valid and if it finds expired certificates, it will exit with a non-zero exit code.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

None

=head1 OPTIONS

Option names can be abbreviated to uniqueness and can be stated with singe or double dashes, and option values can be separated from the option name by a space or '=' (as with Getopt::Long). Option names are also case-
sensitive.
