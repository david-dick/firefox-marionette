DESCRIPTION

    This is a client module to automate the Mozilla Firefox browser via the
    Marionette protocol
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/Protocol>

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 accept_alert

    accepts a currently displayed modal message box

 accept_connections

    Enables or disables accepting new socket connections. By calling this
    method with false the server will not accept any further connections,
    but existing connections will not be forcible closed. Use true to
    re-enable accepting connections.

    Please note that when closing the connection via the client you can
    end-up in a non-recoverable state if it hasn't been enabled before.

 active_element

    returns the active element of the current browsing context's document
    element, if the document element is non-null.

 add_certificate

    accepts a hash as a parameter and adds the specified certificate to the
    Firefox database with the supplied or default trust. Allowed keys are
    below;

      * path - a file system path to a single PEM encoded X.509 certificate
      <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7468#section-5>.

      * string - a string containg a single PEM encoded X.509 certificate
      <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7468#section-5>

      * trust - This is the trustargs
      <https://www.mankier.com/1/certutil#-t> value for NSS
      <https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS>. If defaults to 'C,,';

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $pem_encoded_string = <<'_PEM_';
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MII..
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        _PEM_
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->add_certificate(string => $pem_encoded_string);

 add_cookie

    accepts a single cookie object as the first parameter and adds it to
    the current cookie jar. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

    This method throws an exception if you try to add a cookie for a
    different domain than the current document
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Errors/InvalidCookieDomain>.

 add_header

    accepts a hash of HTTP headers to include in every future HTTP Request.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use UUID();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        my $uuid = UUID::uuid();
        $firefox->add_header( 'Track-my-automated-tests' => $uuid );
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org/');

    these headers are added to any existing headers. To clear headers, see
    the delete_header method

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->delete_header( 'Accept' )->add_header( 'Accept' => 'text/perl' )->go('https://metacpan.org/');

    will only send out an Accept
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept>
    header that looks like Accept: text/perl.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->add_header( 'Accept' => 'text/perl' )->go('https://metacpan.org/');

    by itself, will send out an Accept
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept>
    header that may resemble Accept:
    text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8,
    text/perl. This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 add_login

    accepts a hash of the following keys;

      * host - The scheme + hostname of the page where the login applies,
      for example 'https://www.example.org'.

      * user - The username for the login.

      * password - The password for the login.

      * origin - The scheme + hostname that the form-based login was
      submitted to
      <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-action>.
      Forms with no action attribute default to submitting to the URL of
      the page containing the login form, so that is stored here. This
      field should be omitted (it will be set to undef) for http auth type
      authentications and "" means to match against any form action.

      * realm - The HTTP Realm for which the login was requested. When an
      HTTP server sends a 401 result, the WWW-Authenticate header includes
      a realm. See RFC 2617
      <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617>. If the realm is not
      specified, or it was blank, the hostname is used instead. For HTML
      form logins, this field should not be specified.

      * user_field - The name attribute for the username input in a form.
      Non-form logins should not specify this field.

      * password_field - The name attribute for the password input in a
      form. Non-form logins should not specify this field.

    or a Firefox::Marionette::Login object as the first parameter and adds
    the login to the Firefox login database.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use UUID();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        # for http auth logins
    
        my $http_auth_login = Firefox::Marionette::Login->new(host => 'https://pause.perl.org', user => 'AUSER', password => 'qwerty', realm => 'PAUSE');
        $firefox->add_login($http_auth_login);
        $firefox->go('https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery')->accept_alert(); # this goes to the page and submits the http auth popup
    
        # for form based login
    
        $firefox->add_login(host => 'https://github.com', origin => 'https://github.com', user => 'me@example.org', password => 'qwerty', user_field => 'login', password_field => 'password');
        my $form_login = Firefox::Marionette::Login(host => 'https://github.com', user => 'me2@example.org', password => 'uiop[]', user_field => 'login', password_field => 'password');
    
        # or just directly
    
        $firefox->add_login(host => 'https://github.com', user => 'me2@example.org', password => 'uiop[]', user_field => 'login', password_field => 'password');

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 add_site_header

    accepts a host name and a hash of HTTP headers to include in every
    future HTTP Request that is being sent to that particular host.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use UUID();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        my $uuid = UUID::uuid();
        $firefox->add_site_header( 'metacpan.org', 'Track-my-automated-tests' => $uuid );
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org/');

    these headers are added to any existing headers going to the
    metacpan.org site, but no other site. To clear site headers, see the
    delete_site_header method

 addons

    returns if pre-existing addons (extensions/themes) are allowed to run.
    This will be true for Firefox versions less than 55, as -safe-mode
    cannot be automated.

 alert_text

    Returns the message shown in a currently displayed modal message box

 alive

    This method returns true or false depending on if the Firefox process
    is still running.

 application_type

    returns the application type for the Marionette protocol. Should be
    'gecko'.

 async_script

    accepts a scalar containing a javascript function that is executed in
    the browser. This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

    The executing javascript is subject to the script timeout, which, by
    default is 30 seconds.

 attribute

    accepts an element as the first parameter and a scalar attribute name
    as the second parameter. It returns the initial value of the attribute
    with the supplied name. This method will return the initial content,
    the property method will return the current content.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
        my $element = $firefox->find_id('search_input');
        !defined $element->attribute('value') or die "attribute is not defined!");
        $element->type('Test::More');
        !defined $element->attribute('value') or die "attribute is still not defined!");

 await

    accepts a subroutine reference as a parameter and then executes the
    subroutine. If a not found exception is thrown, this method will sleep
    for sleep_time_in_ms milliseconds and then execute the subroutine
    again. When the subroutine executes successfully, it will return what
    the subroutine returns.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new(sleep_time_in_ms => 5)->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        $firefox->find_id('search-input')->type('Test::More');
    
        $firefox->find_name('lucky')->click();
    
        $firefox->await(sub { $firefox->interactive() && $firefox->find_partial('Download') })->click();

 back

    causes the browser to traverse one step backward in the joint history
    of the current browsing context. The browser will wait for the one step
    backward to complete or the session's page_load duration to elapse
    before returning, which, by default is 5 minutes. This method returns
    itself to aid in chaining methods.

 default_binary_name

    just returns the string 'firefox'. Only of interest when sub-classing.

 browser_version

    This method returns the current version of firefox.

 bye

    accepts a subroutine reference as a parameter and then executes the
    subroutine. If the subroutine executes successfully, this method will
    sleep for sleep_time_in_ms milliseconds and then execute the subroutine
    again. When a not found exception is thrown, this method will return
    itself to aid in chaining methods.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        $firefox->find_id('search-input')->type('Test::More');
    
        $firefox->find_name('lucky')->click();
    
        $firefox->bye(sub { $firefox->find_name('lucky') })->await(sub { $firefox->interactive() && $firefox->find_partial('Download') })->click();

 capabilities

    returns the capabilities of the current firefox binary. You can
    retrieve timeouts or a proxy with this method.

 certificate_as_pem

    accepts a certificate stored in the Firefox database as a parameter and
    returns a PEM encoded X.509 certificate
    <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7468#section-5> as a string.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        # Generating a ca-bundle.crt to STDOUT from the current firefox instance
    
        foreach my $certificate (sort { $a->display_name() cmp $b->display_name } $firefox->certificates()) {
            if ($certificate->is_ca_cert()) {
                print '# ' . $certificate->display_name() . "\n" . $firefox->certificate_as_pem($certificate) . "\n";
            }
        }

    The ca-bundle-for-firefox command that is provided as part of this
    distribution does this.

 certificates

    returns a list of all known certificates in the Firefox database.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        # Sometimes firefox can neglect old certificates.  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1710716
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        foreach my $certificate (grep { $_->is_ca_cert() && $_->not_valid_after() < time } $firefox->certificates()) {
            say "The " . $certificate->display_name() " . certificate has expired and should be removed";
        }

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 child_error

    This method returns the $? (CHILD_ERROR) for the Firefox process, or
    undefined if the process has not yet exited.

 chrome

    changes the scope of subsequent commands to chrome context. This allows
    things like interacting with firefox menu's and buttons outside of the
    browser window.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->chrome();
        $firefox->script(...); # running script in chrome context
        $firefox->content();

    See the context method for an alternative methods for changing the
    context.

 chrome_window_handle

    returns an server-assigned integer identifiers for the current chrome
    window that uniquely identifies it within this Marionette instance.
    This can be used to switch to this window at a later point. This
    corresponds to a window that may itself contain tabs.

 chrome_window_handles

    returns identifiers for each open chrome window for tests interested in
    managing a set of chrome windows and tabs separately.

 clear

    accepts a element as the first parameter and clears any user supplied
    input

 click

    accepts a element as the first parameter and sends a 'click' to it. The
    browser will wait for any page load to complete or the session's
    page_load duration to elapse before returning, which, by default is 5
    minutes. The click method is also used to choose an option in a select
    dropdown.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new(visible => 1)->go('https://ebay.com');
        my $select = $firefox->find_tag('select');
        foreach my $option ($select->find_tag('option')) {
            if ($option->property('value') == 58058) { # Computers/Tablets & Networking
                $option->click();
            }
        }

 close_current_chrome_window_handle

    closes the current chrome window (that is the entire window, not just
    the tabs). It returns a list of still available chrome window handles.
    You will need to switch_to_window to use another window.

 close_current_window_handle

    closes the current window/tab. It returns a list of still available
    window/tab handles.

 content

    changes the scope of subsequent commands to browsing context. This is
    the default for when firefox starts and restricts commands to operating
    in the browser window only.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->chrome();
        $firefox->script(...); # running script in chrome context
        $firefox->content();

    See the context method for an alternative methods for changing the
    context.

 context

    accepts a string as the first parameter, which may be either 'content'
    or 'chrome'. It returns the context type that is Marionette's current
    target for browsing context scoped commands.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        if ($firefox->context() eq 'content') {
           say "I knew that was going to happen";
        }
        my $old_context = $firefox->context('chrome');
        $firefox->script(...); # running script in chrome context
        $firefox->context($old_context);

    See the content and chrome methods for alternative methods for changing
    the context.

 cookies

    returns the contents of the cookie jar in scalar or list context.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://github.com');
        foreach my $cookie ($firefox->cookies()) {
            if (defined $cookie->same_site()) {
                say "Cookie " . $cookie->name() . " has a SameSite of " . $cookie->same_site();
            } else {
                warn "Cookie " . $cookie->name() . " does not have the SameSite attribute defined";
            }
        }

 css

    accepts an element as the first parameter and a scalar CSS property
    name as the second parameter. It returns the value of the computed
    style for that property.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
        say $firefox->find_id('search-input')->css('height');

 current_chrome_window_handle

    see chrome_window_handle.

 delete_certificate

    accepts a certificate stored in the Firefox database as a parameter and
    deletes/distrusts the certificate from the Firefox database.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        foreach my $certificate ($firefox->certificates()) {
            if ($certificate->is_ca_cert()) {
                $firefox->delete_certificate($certificate);
            } else {
                say "This " . $certificate->display_name() " certificate is NOT a certificate authority, therefore it is not being deleted";
            }
        }
        say "Good luck visiting a HTTPS website!";

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 delete_cookie

    deletes a single cookie by name. Accepts a scalar containing the cookie
    name as a parameter. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://github.com');
        foreach my $cookie ($firefox->cookies()) {
            warn "Cookie " . $cookie->name() . " is being deleted";
            $firefox->delete_cookie($cookie->name());
        }
        foreach my $cookie ($firefox->cookies()) {
            die "Should be no cookies here now";
        }

 delete_cookies

    here be cookie monsters! This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

 delete_header

    accepts a list of HTTP header names to delete from future HTTP
    Requests.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        $firefox->delete_header( 'User-Agent', 'Accept', 'Accept-Encoding' );

    will remove the User-Agent
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent>,
    Accept
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept> and
    Accept-Encoding
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding>
    headers from all future requests

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 delete_login

    accepts a login as a parameter.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        foreach my $login ($firefox->logins()) {
            if ($login->user() eq 'me@example.org') {
                $firefox->delete_login($login);
            }
        }

    will remove the logins with the username matching 'me@example.org'.

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 delete_logins

    This method empties the password database.

        use Firefox::Marionette();

    future HTTP Requests.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        $firefox->delete_header( 'metacpan.org', 'User-Agent', 'Accept', 'Accept-Encoding' );

    will remove the User-Agent
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent>,
    Accept
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept> and

    headers from all future requests to metacpan.org.

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 developer

    returns true if the current version of firefox is a developer edition
    <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/> (does the minor
    version number end with an 'b\d+'?) version.

 dismiss_alert

    dismisses a currently displayed modal message box

 download

    accepts a filesystem path and returns a matching filehandle. This is
    trivial for locally running firefox, but sufficiently complex to
    justify the method for a remote firefox running over ssh.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( host => '10.1.2.3' )->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        $firefox->find_class('container-fluid')->find_id('search-input')->type('Test::More');
    
        $firefox->find('//button[@name="lucky"]')->click();
    
        $firefox->await(sub { $firefox->interactive() && $firefox->find_partial('Download') })->click();
    
        while(!$firefox->downloads()) { sleep 1 }
    
        foreach my $path ($firefox->downloads()) {
    
            my $handle = $firefox->download($path);
    
            # do something with downloaded file handle
    
        }

 downloading

    returns true if any files in downloads end in .part

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        $firefox->find_class('container-fluid')->find_id('search-input')->type('Test::More');
    
        $firefox->find('//button[@name="lucky"]')->click();
    
        $firefox->await(sub { $firefox->interactive() && $firefox->find_partial('Download') })->click();
    
        while(!$firefox->downloads()) { sleep 1 }
    
        while($firefox->downloading()) { sleep 1 }
    
        foreach my $path ($firefox->downloads()) {
            say $path;
        }

 downloads

    returns a list of file paths (including partial downloads) of downloads
    during this Firefox session.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        $firefox->find_class('container-fluid')->find_id('search-input')->type('Test::More');
    
        $firefox->find('//button[@name="lucky"]')->click();
    
        $firefox->await(sub { $firefox->interactive() && $firefox->find_partial('Download') })->click();
    
        while(!$firefox->downloads()) { sleep 1 }
    
        foreach my $path ($firefox->downloads()) {
            say $path;

 forward

    causes the browser to traverse one step forward in the joint history of
    the current browsing context. The browser will wait for the one step

    before returning, which, by default is 5 minutes. This method returns
    itself to aid in chaining methods.

 full_screen

    full screens the firefox window. This method returns itself to aid in
    chaining methods.

 go

    Navigates the current browsing context to the given URI and waits for
    the document to load or the session's page_load duration to elapse
    before returning, which, by default is 5 minutes.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org/'); # will only return when metacpan.org is FULLY loaded (including all images / js / css)

    To make the go method return quicker, you need to set the page load
    strategy capability to an appropriate value, such as below;

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( capabilities => Firefox::Marionette::Capabilities->new( page_load_strategy => 'eager' ));
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org/'); # will return once the main document has been loaded and parsed, but BEFORE sub-resources (images/stylesheets/frames) have been loaded.

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 har

    returns a hashref representing the http archive
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)> of the session. This

    timeout) if the original devtools
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools> window is closed. The
    hashref has been designed to be accepted by the Archive::Har module.
    This function should be considered experimental. Feedback welcome.

        my $har = Archive::Har->new();
        $har->hashref($firefox->har());
    
        foreach my $entry ($har->entries()) {

    chaining methods.

 mouse_down

    accepts a parameter describing which mouse button the method should
    apply to (left, middle or right) and returns an action for use in the
    perform method that corresponding with a mouse button being depressed.

 mouse_move

    accepts a element parameter, or a ( x => 0, y => 0 ) type hash manually
    describing exactly where to move the mouse to and returns an action for
    use in the perform method that corresponding with such a mouse
    movement, either to the specified co-ordinates or to the middle of the
    supplied element parameter.

 mouse_up

    accepts a parameter describing which mouse button the method should
    apply to (left, middle or right) and returns an action for use in the
    perform method that corresponding with a mouse button being released.

 new

    accepts an optional hash as a parameter. Allowed keys are below;

      * addons - should any firefox extensions and themes be available in
      this session. This defaults to "0".

      * binary - use the specified path to the Firefox
      <https://firefox.org/> binary, rather than the default path.

      * capabilities - use the supplied capabilities object, for example to
      set whether the browser should accept insecure certs or whether the
      browser should use a proxy.

      * chatty - Firefox is extremely chatty on the network, including
      checking for the lastest malware/phishing sites, updates to
      firefox/etc. This option is therefore off ("0") by default, however,
      it can be switched on ("1") if required. Even with chatty switched
      off, connections to firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com will still
      be made <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c13>.
      The only way to prevent this seems to be to set
      firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com to 127.0.0.1 via /etc/hosts
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//etc/hosts>. NOTE: that this option
      only works when profile_name/profile is not specified.

      * console - show the browser console
      <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console/>
      when the browser is launched. This defaults to "0" (off).

      * debug - should firefox's debug to be available via STDERR. This
      defaults to "0". Any ssh connections will also be printed to STDERR.
      This defaults to "0" (off).

      * developer - only allow a developer edition
      <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/> to be launched.
      This defaults to "0" (off).

      * height - set the height
      <http://kb.mozillazine.org/Command_line_arguments#List_of_command_line_arguments_.28incomplete.29>
      of the initial firefox window

      * har - begin the session with the devtools
      <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools> window opened in a
      separate window. The HAR Export Trigger
      <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/har-export-trigger/>
      addon will be loaded into the new session automatically, which means
      that -safe-mode will not be activated for this session AND this
      functionality will only be available for Firefox 61+.

      * host - use ssh <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1> to create and
      automate firefox on the specified host. See REMOTE AUTOMATION OF
      FIREFOX VIA SSH.

      * implicit - a shortcut to allow directly providing the implicit
      timeout, instead of needing to use timeouts from the capabilities
      parameter. Overrides all longer ways.

      * mime_types - any MIME types that Firefox will encounter during this
      session. MIME types that are not specified will result in a hung
      browser (the File Download popup will appear).

      * nightly - only allow a nightly release
      <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly> to
      be launched. This defaults to "0" (off).

      * port - if the "host" parameter is also set, use ssh
      <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1> to create and automate firefox via
      the specified port. See REMOTE AUTOMATION OF FIREFOX VIA SSH.

      * page_load - a shortcut to allow directly providing the page_load
      timeout, instead of needing to use timeouts from the capabilities
      parameter. Overrides all longer ways.

      * profile - create a new profile based on the supplied profile. NOTE:
      firefox ignores any changes made to the profile on the disk while it
      is running.

      * profile_name - pick a specific existing profile to automate, rather
      than creating a new profile. Firefox <https://firefox.com> refuses to
      allow more than one instance of a profile to run at the same time.
      Profile names can be obtained by using the
      Firefox::Marionette::Profile::names() method. NOTE: firefox ignores
      any changes made to the profile on the disk while it is running.

      * reconnect - an experimental parameter to allow a reconnection to
      firefox that a connection has been discontinued. See the survive
      parameter.

      * script - a shortcut to allow directly providing the script timeout,
      instead of needing to use timeouts from the capabilities parameter.
      Overrides all longer ways.

      * seer - this option is switched off "0" by default. When it is
      switched on "1", it will activate the various speculative and
      pre-fetch options for firefox. NOTE: that this option only works when
      profile_name/profile is not specified.

      * sleep_time_in_ms - the amount of time (in milliseconds) that this
      module should sleep when unsuccessfully calling the subroutine
      provided to the await or bye methods. This defaults to "1"
      millisecond.

      * survive - if this is set to a true value, firefox will not
      automatically exit when the object goes out of scope. See the
      reconnect parameter for an experimental technique for reconnecting.

      * trust - give a path to a root certificate
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate> encoded as a PEM
      encoded X.509 certificate
      <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7468#section-5> that will
      be trusted for this session.

      * timeouts - a shortcut to allow directly providing a timeout object,
      instead of needing to use timeouts from the capabilities parameter.
      Overrides the timeouts provided (if any) in the capabilities
      parameter.

      * user - if the "host" parameter is also set, use ssh
      <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1> to create and automate firefox with
      the specified user. See REMOTE AUTOMATION OF FIREFOX VIA SSH. The
      user will default to the current user name.

      * visible - should firefox be visible on the desktop. This defaults
      to "0".

      * waterfox - only allow a binary that looks like a waterfox version
      <https://www.waterfox.net/> to be launched.

      * width - set the width
      <http://kb.mozillazine.org/Command_line_arguments#List_of_command_line_arguments_.28incomplete.29>
      of the initial firefox window

    This method returns a new Firefox::Marionette object, connected to an
    instance of firefox <https://firefox.com>. In a non MacOS/Win32/Cygwin
    environment, if necessary (no DISPLAY variable can be found and the
    visible parameter to the new method has been set to true) and possible
    (Xvfb can be executed successfully), this method will also
    automatically start an Xvfb <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb>
    instance.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $remote_darwin_firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new(
                         debug => 1,
                         host => '10.1.2.3',
                         trust => '/path/to/root_ca.pem',
                         firefox => '/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox'
                                                            ); # start a temporary profile for a remote firefox and load a new CA into the temp profile
        ...
    
        foreach my $profile_name (Firefox::Marionette::Profile->names()) {
            my $firefox_with_existing_profile = Firefox::Marionette->new( profile_name => $profile_name, visible => 1 );
            ...
        }

 new_window

    accepts an optional hash as the parameter. Allowed keys are below;

      * focus - a boolean field representing if the new window be opened in
      the foreground (focused) or background (not focused). Defaults to
      false.

      * private - a boolean field representing if the new window should be
      a private window. Defaults to false.

      * type - the type of the new window. Can be one of 'tab' or 'window'.
      Defaults to 'tab'.

    Returns the window handle for the new window.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        my $window_handle = $firefox->new_window(type => 'tab');
    
        $firefox->switch_to_window($window_handle);

 new_session

    creates a new WebDriver session. It is expected that the caller
    performs the necessary checks on the requested capabilities to be
    WebDriver conforming. The WebDriver service offered by Marionette does
    not match or negotiate capabilities beyond type and bounds checks.

 nightly

    returns true if the current version of firefox is a nightly release
    <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly> (does
    the minor version number end with an 'a1'?)

 paper_sizes

    returns a list of all the recognised names for paper sizes, such as A4
    or LEGAL.

 pause

    accepts a parameter in milliseconds and returns a corresponding action
    for the perform method that will cause a pause in the chain of actions
    given to the perform method.

 pdf

    accepts a optional hash as the first parameter with the following
    allowed keys;

      * landscape - Paper orientation. Boolean value. Defaults to false

      * margin - A hash describing the margins. The hash may have the
      following optional keys, 'top', 'left', 'right' and 'bottom'. All
      these keys are in cm and default to 1 (~0.4 inches)

      * page - A hash describing the page. The hash may have the following
      keys; 'height' and 'width'. Both keys are in cm and default to US
      letter size. See the 'size' key.

      * print_background - Print background graphics. Boolean value.
      Defaults to false.

      * raw - rather than a file handle containing the PDF, the binary PDF
      will be returned.

      * scale - Scale of the webpage rendering. Defaults to 1.

      * size - The desired size (width and height) of the pdf, specified by
      name. See the page key for an alternative and the paper_sizes method
      for a list of accepted page size names.

      * shrink_to_fit - Whether or not to override page size as defined by
      CSS. Boolean value. Defaults to true.

    returns a File::Temp object containing a PDF encoded version of the
    current page for printing.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
        my $handle = $firefox->pdf();
        foreach my $paper_size ($firefox->paper_sizes()) {
                $handle = $firefox->pdf(size => $paper_size, landscape => 1, margin => { top => 0.5, left => 1.5 });
                ...
                print $firefox->pdf(page => { width => 21, height => 27 }, raw => 1);
                ...
        }

 perform

    accepts a list of actions (see mouse_up, mouse_down, mouse_move, pause,
    key_down and key_up) and performs these actions in sequence. This
    allows fine control over interactions, including sending right clicks
    to the browser and sending Control, Alt and other special keys. The
    release method will complete outstanding actions (such as mouse_up or
    key_up actions).

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use Firefox::Marionette::Keys qw(:all);
        use Firefox::Marionette::Buttons qw(:all);
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        $firefox->chrome()->perform(
                                     $firefox->key_down(CONTROL()),
                                     $firefox->key_down('l'),
                                     $firefox->key_up('l'),
                                     $firefox->key_up(CONTROL())
                                   )->content();
    
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org');
        my $help_button = $firefox->find_class('btn search-btn help-btn');
        $firefox->perform(
                                      $firefox->mouse_move($help_button),
                                      $firefox->mouse_down(RIGHT_BUTTON()),
                                      $firefox->pause(4),
                                      $firefox->mouse_up(RIGHT_BUTTON()),
                    );

    See the release method for an alternative for manually specifying all
    the mouse_up and key_up methods

 profile_directory

    returns the profile directory used by the current instance of firefox.
    This is mainly intended for debugging firefox. Firefox is not designed
    to cope with these files being altered while firefox is running.

 property

    accepts an element as the first parameter and a scalar attribute name
    as the second parameter. It returns the current value of the property
    with the supplied name. This method will return the current content,
    the attribute method will return the initial content.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
        my $element = $firefox->find_id('search_input');
        $element->property('value') eq '' or die "Initial property is the empty string";
        $element->type('Test::More');
        $element->property('value') eq 'Test::More' or die "This property should have changed!";
    
        # OR getting the innerHTML property
    
        my $title = $firefox->find_tag('title')->property('innerHTML'); # same as $firefox->title();

 pwd_mgr_lock

    Accepts a new primary password
    <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-primary-password-protect-stored-logins>
    and locks the Password Manager
    <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins>
    with it.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use IO::Prompt();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
        my $password = IO::Prompt::prompt(-echo => q[*], "Please enter the password for the Firefox Password Manager:");
        $firefox->pwd_mgr_lock($password);
        $firefox->pwd_mgr_logout();
        # now no-one can access the Password Manager Database without the value in $password

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 pwd_mgr_login

    Accepts the primary password
    <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-primary-password-protect-stored-logins>
    and allows the user to access the Password Manager
    <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins>.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use IO::Prompt();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( profile_name => 'default' );
        my $password = IO::Prompt::prompt(-echo => q[*], "Please enter the password for the Firefox Password Manager:");
        $firefox->pwd_mgr_login($password);
        ...
        # access the Password Database.
        ...
        $firefox->pwd_mgr_logout();
        ...
        # no longer able to access the Password Database.

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 pwd_mgr_logout

    Logs the user out of being able to access the Password Manager
    <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins>.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use IO::Prompt();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( profile_name => 'default' );
        my $password = IO::Prompt::prompt(-echo => q[*], "Please enter the password for the Firefox Password Manager:");
        $firefox->pwd_mgr_login($password);
        ...
        # access the Password Database.
        ...
        $firefox->pwd_mgr_logout();
        ...
        # no longer able to access the Password Database.

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 pwd_mgr_needs_login

    returns true or false if the Password Manager
    <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins>
    has been locked and needs a primary password
    <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-primary-password-protect-stored-logins>
    to access it.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use IO::Prompt();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( profile_name => 'default' );
        if ($firefox->pwd_mgr_needs_login()) {
          my $password = IO::Prompt::prompt(-echo => q[*], "Please enter the password for the Firefox Password Manager:");
          $firefox->pwd_mgr_login($password);
        }

 quit

    Marionette will stop accepting new connections before ending the
    current session, and finally attempting to quit the application. This
    method returns the $? (CHILD_ERROR) value for the Firefox process

 rect

    accepts a element as the first parameter and returns the current
    position and size of the element

 refresh

    refreshes the current page. The browser will wait for the page to
    completely refresh or the session's page_load duration to elapse before
    returning, which, by default is 5 minutes. This method returns itself
    to aid in chaining methods.

 release

    completes any outstanding actions issued by the perform method.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use Firefox::Marionette::Keys qw(:all);
        use Firefox::Marionette::Buttons qw(:all);
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        $firefox->chrome()->perform(
                                     $firefox->key_down(CONTROL()),
                                     $firefox->key_down('l'),
                                   )->release()->content();
    
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org');
        my $help_button = $firefox->find_class('btn search-btn help-btn');
        $firefox->perform(
                                      $firefox->mouse_move($help_button),
                                      $firefox->mouse_down(RIGHT_BUTTON()),
                                      $firefox->pause(4),
                    )->release();

 restart

    restarts the browser. After the restart, capabilities should be
    restored. The same profile settings should be applied, but the current
    state of the browser (such as the uri will be reset (like after a
    normal browser restart). This method is primarily intended for use by
    the update method. Not sure if this is useful by itself.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        $firefox->restart(); # but why?

    This method returns itself to aid in chaining methods.

 screen_orientation

    returns the current browser orientation. This will be one of the valid
    primary orientation values 'portrait-primary', 'landscape-primary',
    'portrait-secondary', or 'landscape-secondary'. This method is only
    currently available on Android (Fennec).

 script

    accepts a scalar containing a javascript function body that is executed
    in the browser, and an optional hash as a second parameter. Allowed
    keys are below;

      * args - The reference to a list is the arguments passed to the
      function body.

      * filename - Filename of the client's program where this script is
      evaluated.

      * line - Line in the client's program where this script is evaluated.

      * new - Forces the script to be evaluated in a fresh sandbox. Note
      that if it is undefined, the script will normally be evaluted in a
      fresh sandbox.

      * sandbox - Name of the sandbox to evaluate the script in. The
      sandbox is cached for later re-use on the same window
      <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window> object if
      new is false. If he parameter is undefined, the script is evaluated
      in a mutable sandbox. If the parameter is "system", it will be
      evaluted in a sandbox with elevated system privileges, equivalent to
      chrome space.

      * timeout - A timeout to override the default script timeout, which,
      by default is 30 seconds.

    Returns the result of the javascript function.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new()->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        if ($firefox->script('return window.find("lucky");')) {
            # luckily!
        }
    
        my $search_input = $firefox->find_by_id('search-input');
    
        $firefox->script('arguments[0].style.backgroundColor = "red"', args => [ $search_input ]); # turn the search input box red

    The executing javascript is subject to the script timeout, which, by
    default is 30 seconds.

 selfie

    returns a File::Temp object containing a lossless PNG image screenshot.
    If an element is passed as a parameter, the screenshot will be
    restricted to the element.

    If an element is not passed as a parameter and the current context is
    'chrome', a screenshot of the current viewport will be returned.

    If an element is not passed as a parameter and the current context is
    'content', a screenshot of the current frame will be returned.

    The parameters after the element parameter are taken to be a optional
    hash with the following allowed keys;

      * hash - return a SHA256 hex encoded digest of the PNG image rather
      than the image itself

      * full - take a screenshot of the whole document unless the first
      element parameter has been supplied.

      * raw - rather than a file handle containing the screenshot, the
      binary PNG image will be returned.

      * scroll - scroll to the element supplied

      * highlights - a reference to a list containing elements to draw a
      highlight around. Not available in Firefox 70
      <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/70#WebDriver_conformance_Marionette>
      onwards.

 send_alert_text

    sends keys to the input field of a currently displayed modal message
    box

 sleep_time_in_ms

    accepts a new time to sleep in await or bye methods and returns the
    previous time. The default time is "1" millisecond.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new(sleep_time_in_ms => 5); # setting default time to 5 milliseconds
    
        my $old_time_in_ms = $firefox->sleep_time_in_ms(8); # setting default time to 8 milliseconds, returning 5 (milliseconds)

 strip

    returns the page source of the content document after an attempt has
    been made to remove typical firefox html wrappers of non html content
    types such as text/plain and application/json. See the json method for
    an alternative when dealing with response content types such as
    application/json and html for an alterative when dealing with html
    content types. This is a convenience method that wraps the html method.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use JSON();
        use v5.10;
    
        say JSON::decode_json(Firefox::Marionette->new()->go("https://fastapi.metacpan.org/v1/download_url/Firefox::Marionette")->strip())->{version};

    Note that this method will assume the bytes it receives from the html
    method are UTF-8 encoded and will translate accordingly, throwing an
    exception in the process if the bytes are not UTF-8 encoded.

 switch_to_frame

    accepts a frame as a parameter and switches to it within the current
    window.

 switch_to_parent_frame

    set the current browsing context for future commands to the parent of
    the current browsing context

 switch_to_window

    accepts a window handle (either the result of window_handles or a
    window name as a parameter and switches focus to this window.

 tag_name

    accepts a Firefox::Marionette::Element object as the first parameter
    and returns the relevant tag name. For example 'a
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a>' or
    'input
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input>'.

 text

    accepts a element as the first parameter and returns the text that is
    contained by that element (if any)

 timeouts

    returns the current timeouts for page loading, searching, and scripts.

 title

    returns the current title
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title> of
    the window.

 type

    accepts an element as the first parameter and a string as the second
    parameter. It sends the string to the specified element in the current
    page, such as filling out a text box. This method returns itself to aid
    in chaining methods.

 update

    queries the Update Services and applies any available updates. Restarts
    the browser if necessary to complete the update.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
        use v5.10;
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        my $update = $firefox->update();
    
        while($update->successful()) {
            $update = $firefox->update();
        }
    
        say "Updated to " . $update->display_version() . " - Build ID " . $update->build_id();
    
        $firefox->quit();

    returns a status object that contains useful information about any
    updates that occurred.

 uninstall

    accepts the GUID for the addon to uninstall. The GUID is returned when
    from the install method. This method returns itself to aid in chaining
    methods.

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new();
    
        my $extension_id = $firefox->install('/full/path/to/gnu_terry_pratchett-0.4-an+fx.xpi');
    
        # do something
    
        $firefox->uninstall($extension_id); # not recommended to uninstall this extension IRL.

 uri

    returns the current URI of current top level browsing context for
    Desktop. It is equivalent to the javascript document.location.href

 win32_organisation

    accepts a parameter of a Win32 product name and returns the matching
    organisation. Only of interest when sub-classing.

 win32_product_names

    returns a hash of known Windows product names (such as 'Mozilla
    Firefox') with priority orders. The lower the priority will determine
    the order that this module will check for the existance of this
    product. Only of interest when sub-classing.

 window_handle

    returns the current window's handle. On desktop this typically
    corresponds to the currently selected tab. returns an opaque
    server-assigned identifier to this window that uniquely identifies it
    within this Marionette instance. This can be used to switch to this
    window at a later point.

 window_handles

    returns a list of top-level browsing contexts. On desktop this
    typically corresponds to the set of open tabs for browser windows, or
    the window itself for non-browser chrome windows. Each window handle is
    assigned by the server and is guaranteed unique, however the return
    array does not have a specified ordering.

 window_rect

    accepts an optional position and size as a parameter, sets the current
    browser window to that position and size and returns the previous
    position, size and state of the browser window. If no parameter is
    supplied, it returns the current position, size and state of the
    browser window.

 window_type

    returns the current window's type. This should be 'navigator:browser'.

 xvfb_pid

    returns the pid of the xvfb process if it exists.

 xvfb_display

    returns the value for the DISPLAY environment variable if one has been
    generated for the xvfb environment.

 xvfb_xauthority

    returns the value for the XAUTHORITY environment variable if one has
    been generated for the xvfb environment

AUTOMATING THE FIREFOX PASSWORD MANAGER

    This module allows you to login to a website without ever directly
    handling usernames and password details. The Password Manager may be
    preloaded with appropriate passwords and locked, like so;

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( profile_name => 'locked' ); # using a pre-built profile called 'locked'
        if ($firefox->pwd_mgr_needs_login()) {
            my $new_password = IO::Prompt::prompt(-echo => q[*], 'Enter the password for the locked profile:');
            $firefox->pwd_mgr_login($password);
        } else {
            my $new_password = IO::Prompt::prompt(-echo => q[*], 'Enter the new password for the locked profile:');
            $firefox->pwd_mgr_lock($password);
        }
        ...
        $firefox->pwd_mgr_logout();

    Usernames and passwords (for both HTTP Authentication popups and HTML
    Form based logins) may be added, viewed and deleted.

        use WebService::HIBP();
    
        my $hibp = WebService::HIBP->new();
    
        $firefox->add_login(host => 'https://github.com', user => 'me@example.org', password => 'qwerty', user_field => 'login', password_field => 'password');
        $firefox->add_login(host => 'https://pause.perl.org', user => 'AUSER', password => 'qwerty', realm => 'PAUSE');
        ...
        foreach my $login ($firefox->logins()) {
            if ($hibp->password($login->password())) { # does NOT send the password to the HIBP webservice
                warn "HIBP reports that your password for the " . $login->user() " account at " . $login->host() . " has been found in a data breach";
                $firefox->delete_login($login); # how could this possibly help?
            }
        }

    And used to fill in login prompts without explicitly knowing the
    account details.

        $firefox->go('https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery')->accept_alert(); # this goes to the page and submits the http auth popup
    
        $firefox->go('https://github.com/login')->fill_login(); # fill the login and password fields without needing to see them

REMOTE AUTOMATION OF FIREFOX VIA SSH

        use Firefox::Marionette();
    
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( host => 'remote.example.org', debug => 1 );
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        # OR specify a different user to login as ...
        
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( host => 'remote.example.org', user => 'R2D2', debug => 1 );
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org/');
    
        # OR specify a different port to connect to
        
        my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette->new( host => 'remote.example.org', port => 2222, debug => 1 );
        $firefox->go('https://metacpan.org/');

    This module has support for creating and automating an instance of
    Firefox on a remote node. It has been tested against a number of
    operating systems, including recent version of Windows 10 or Windows
    Server 2019
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse>,
    OS X, and Linux and BSD distributions. It expects to be able to login
    to the remote node via public key authentication. It can be further
    secured via the command
    <https://man.openbsd.org/sshd#command=_command_> option in the OpenSSH
    <https://www.openssh.com/> authorized_keys
    <https://man.openbsd.org/sshd#AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE_FORMAT> file such
    as;

        no-agent-forwarding,no-pty,no-X11-forwarding,permitopen="127.0.0.1:*",command="/usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-cmd-marionette" ssh-rsa AAAA ... == user@server

    As an example, the ssh-auth-cmd-marionette command is provided as part
    of this distribution.

    When using ssh, Firefox::Marionette will attempt to pass the TMPDIR
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPDIR> environment variable across the
    ssh connection to make cleanups easier. In order to allow this, the
    AcceptEnv <https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#AcceptEnv> setting in
    the remote sshd configuration should be set to allow TMPDIR, which will
    look like;

        AcceptEnv TMPDIR

    This module uses ControlMaster
    <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#ControlMaster> functionality when
    using ssh, for a useful speedup of executing remote commands.
    Unfortunately, when using ssh to move from a cygwin
    <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SSH_connection_caching>, Windows 10 or
    Windows Server 2019
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse>
    node to a remote environment, we cannot use ControlMaster, because at
    this time, Windows does not support ControlMaster
    <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/96> and
    therefore this type of automation is still possible, but slower than
    other client platforms.

DIAGNOSTICS

    Failed to correctly setup the Firefox process

      The module was unable to retrieve a session id and capabilities from
      Firefox when it requests a new_session as part of the initial setup
      of the connection to Firefox.

    Failed to correctly determined the Firefox process id through the
    initial connection capabilities

      The module was found that firefox is reporting through it's
      Capabilities object a different process id than this module was
      using. This is probably a bug in this module's logic. Please report
      as described in the BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section below.

    '%s --version' did not produce output that could be parsed. Assuming
    modern Marionette is available:%s

      The Firefox binary did not produce a version number that could be
